I've got a (relatively) stable version of my Emacs configuration as a literate document now.  It's easy to read either on [my GitHub](https://github.com/renzmann/.emacs.d#my-literate-emacsd) or [my website](https://robbmann.io/emacsd).  The website version may lag behind my GitHub verison a bit, but they should be pretty close.  Many thanks to the maintainers of [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/) for making it possible.
