# Motivators
+ I use all of Windows, macOS, Linux desktop (mostly ubuntu) and Linux via SSH in
  an almost even 25%/25%/25%/25% split.
+ I often log into brand new machines that have none of my favorite configuration
+ I want all my favorite tools to be available to me in under one minute from
  login


# Need to cover
+ Package manager
  - Windows: chocolatey
  - macOS: Homebrew
  - Linux: whatever you use (pacman, apt-get, yum)
+ Editor: nvim and justification
  - Cross platform
  - installs fast
  - lua is very easy
  - configuration/keybindings
+ Shell
  - Windows: powershell
  - macOS/Linux: bash  (old school but reliable)
+ Fonts
  - detecting nerd fonts
  - devicons
