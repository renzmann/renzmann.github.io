I'm pretty happy with my (neo)vim setup. I can walk into basically any code base
with it and usually I can be useful wielding it. There comes a point, though,
where we hit a wall and we look at things like Jupyter or VSCode and think
"damn, that actually is pretty useful."  This has started happening more
frequently than not as more of my workflow transitioned to terminal-based
tooling and suddenly I found myself lacking some of the basics we need to do
useful data science, like rich text (math) and images (plots).

What I've decided to do is go on a journey to finally tame the beast, and build
a rocking emacs setup specifically with the common data scientist in mind.
