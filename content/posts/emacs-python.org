#+TITLE: Python in Emacs: Vanilla Still Reigns Supreme

* Running interpreter
** Customizing interpreter program
+ =python-interpreter=
+ =python-shell-virtualenv-root=
+ =python-shell-interpreter=
+ =python-shell-interpreter-args=
+ =python-shell-exec-path=

** Running the shell dedicated to the project, rather than buffer
One quick way: =C-u C-x p x=, which is =project-execute-extended-command=,
followed by inserting the venv path at the beginning.  Then use this shell for
everything.

* Completion
** Setup of *Completions*
See my previous article or .emacs.d.

** Install =pyreadline3= on Windows

** Abbrevs to save typing
*** Enabling =abbrev-mode= and automatic expansion with =python-skeleton-autoinsert=
*** ifnamemain to get main block
*** =write-abbrev-file= is something to try out
*** =dabbrev-expand= vs =dabbrev-completion=
Use =dabbrev-expand= for recent words, and =dabbrev-completion= for symbol
completion after starting project shell.

* Relative imports in the shell with =python-shell-package-enable=

* LSP and =eglot=

* Keyboard motions

* Templating and skeletons

* Checking code
** =python-check= and =python-check-command=
** Import fixing with =isort= is built-in
*** =python-sort-imports=
*** =python-add-import=
*** =python-remove-import=
*** =python-fix-imports= is built-in but requires =pyflakes=

* Navigation and grepping
** FFAP works with a module at point if inferior shell is running
** =imenu=
*** =python-imenu-create-flat-index=
*** =python-imenu-format-item-label-function=
*** =python-imenu-format-parent-item-label-function=
*** =python-imenu-format-parent-item-jump-label-function=

* Useful keybindings
Make a small function for detecting and inserting .venv path.

* Debugging with =pdb=

* Tramp just works
** =enable-remote-dir-locals=
** =python-shell-with-environment=
