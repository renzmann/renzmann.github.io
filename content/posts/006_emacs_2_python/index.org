#+title: Emacs Part 2: Python (Vanilla is a Powerful Flavor)
#+date: 2022-08-08

* Intro
** Not many great up-to date guides on Python in Emacs
** Most immediately tell you to install lsp-mode, or elpy if it's old
** avoiding virtualenv wrapper plugins
** Going to get to =eglot= eventually, but first what can we do without it?
*** (spiderman meme "nothing without LSP")

* My stack - easy to modify each part
** eshell as our platform-independent shell
** poetry as the package manager
** pyright as our compiler
** My "chinook" Make project as a starting template

* Setting up a new project
** cookie-cutter in a fresh copy
** poetry install from a shell
** =C-u C-c C-p= to start python shell as =poetry run python=
** =M-x compile= to run =poetry run pyright=
