** DONE Moving My Emacs Configuration to a Literate Programming Document

I've got a (relatively) stable version of my Emacs configuration as a literate document now.  It's easy to read either on [[https://github.com/renzmann/.emacs.d#my-literate-emacsd][my GitHub]] or [[https://robbmann.io/emacsd][my website]].  The website version may lag behind my GitHub verison a bit, but they should be pretty close.  Many thanks to the maintainers of [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]] for making it possible.


** DONE Virtual Environments with Eglot, Tramp, and Pyright :python:lsp:eglot:tramp:remote:
:properties:
:export_file_name: emacs-eglot-pyrightconfig
:export_date: <2022-11-19 Sat>
:end:

*** Motivation

My most reliable setup for developing Python projects on remote hosts with LSP support
 so far has been with [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][eglot]] and [[https://github.com/microsoft/pyright][pyright]].  I've also tried [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/][lsp-mode]] with ~pyright~, and
both of ~lsp-mode~ and ~eglot~ with the [[https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server][python-lsp-server]], however I've landed on ~eglot~ +
~pyright~ for a few reasons:

1. ~eglot~ requires zero configuration to work over Tramp, unlike ~lsp-mode~.
2. Fewest number of Tramp hangs.  This /could/ just be a symptom of my particular setup,
   though.
3. ~eglot~ will have built-in support in future Emacs versions.  This may or may not be
   worth a damn to other Emacs users.
4. ~pyright~ has been strictly faster at error checking and diagnostic updates as
   compared to ~python-language-server~ in the machines I'm using.

One hiccup remained though: ~pyright~ is typically a system or user installation, not
something you install per virtual environment.  Getting ~pyright~ to see the virtual
environment of my choosing , and correctly report which dependencies are installed was a
bit of a hassle, but I think my favorite solution so far has been to configure the virtual
environment through the ~pyrightconfig.json~ file at the root of my project, and just have
this file ignored by git.  Typically, ~pyrightconfig.json~ looks like this:

#+begin_src js
{
    "venvPath": "/absolute/path/to/dir/",
    "venv": ".venv"
}
#+end_src

I'm pretty happy with the other default configurations for ~pyright~, so I leave those be,
and just configure the virtual environment path this way.  What was annoying me, though,
is that I'd need to write out this absolute path for each machine I clone a project into,
since relative paths and shortcuts using ~~~ aren't supported.  Much better if we can just
have Emacs do it for us.

In the spirit of other Emacs/Python tools like ~pythonic~ and ~pyvenv~ for activating virtual
environments, I wanted something that would just prompt for a directory using
=completing-read=, and then populate the contents of ~pyrightconfig.json~ automatically based
on my selection.

*** Getting Functions That Write ~pyrightconfig.json~

*Edit 2022-11-20:* Thanks to Mickey Petersen of [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/][mastering emacs]] for pointing out that
=json-encode= exists.  I originally had my own function =pyrightconfig--json-contents= here,
but I've modified the function below to use this built-in version instead.


We really just need to do three things:

1. Prompt for a directory that houses a Python virtual environment
2. Break the result into an absolute parent path + base name, cleaning any Tramp prefix in
   the process
3. Write the contents of =pyrightconfig--json-contents= using the previous result to a file
   in the version control root.

It's worth mentioning that we /must/ put this file in the VC root, otherwise ~eglot~ just
won't pick it up.  For my purposes, the VC system will always be git, so I'm going to make
an assumption here and use =vc-git-root= instead of something more generic.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun pyrightconfig-write (virtualenv)
  (interactive "DEnv: ")

  (let* (;; file-truename and tramp-file-local-name ensure that neither `~' nor
         ;; the Tramp prefix (e.g. "/ssh:my-host:") wind up in the final
         ;; absolute directory path.

Here's a quick demo where I interactively choose a virtual environment directory, write
the ~pyrightconfig.json~, launch ~eglot~, and use =M-.= to leverage the LSP's jump-to-definition
of a library, then show that the library we jumped to is indeed inside the virtual
environment.

*** Follow-ups

Feel free to [[https://github.com/renzmann/.emacs.d/blob/30480545b04ac05448af32bd796d8cb8edda531f/site-lisp/pyrightconfig.el][take this package]] and modify it to suit your needs.  Over time I might make
some modifications to it:

1. Maybe integrate with the variety of ~activate~ functions?  So activating or setting a
   venv root for use with ~run-python~ automatically sets this.
2. Support other VC roots than just git
3. I'd love to get to VSCode-like intelligence about common venv locations and just prompt
   for those automatically through =completing-read=, instead of going through the pathing
   processing myself.  Maybe that would become a function like =pyrightconfig-suggest=.
