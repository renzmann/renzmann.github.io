  <h1>Virtual Environments with Eglot, Tramp and Pyright</h1>
  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>
    My most reliable setup for developing Python projects on remote hosts with LSP
    support so far has been with [eglot](https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot) and
    [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright).  I've also tried
    [lsp-mode](https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/) with `pyright`, and both of
    `lsp-mode` and `eglot` with the
    [python-lsp-server](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server), however
    I've landed on `eglot` + `pyright` for a few reasons:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <code>eglot</code> requires zero configuration to work over Tramp, unlike
      `lsp-mode`.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fewest number of Tramp hangs.  This _could_ just be a symptom of my
      particular setup, though.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>eglot</code> will have built-in support in future Emacs versions.
      This may or may not be worth a damn to other Emacs users.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    One hiccup remained though: `pyright` is typically a system or user
    installation, not something you install per virtual environment.  Getting
    `pyright` to see the virtual environment of my choosing , and correctly
    report which dependencies are installed was a bit of a hassle, but I think
    my favorite solution so far has been to configure the virtual environment
    through the `pyrightconfig.json` file at the root of my project, and just
    have this file ignored by git.  Typically, `pyrightconfig.json` looks like
    this:
  </p>

  <pre>
{
    "venvPath": "/absolute/path/to/dir/",
    "venv": ".venv"
}
  </pre>

  <p>
    I'm pretty happy with the other default configurations for `pyright`, so I
    leave those be, and just configure the virtual environment path this way.
    What was annoying me, though, is that I'd need to write out this absolute
    path for each machine I clone a project into, since relative paths and
    shortcuts using `~` aren't supported.  Much better if we can just have Emacs
    do it for us.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the spirit of other Emacs/Python tools like `pythonic` and `pyvenv` for
    activating virtual environments, I wanted something that would just prompt
    for a directory using `completing-read`, and then populate the contents of
    `pyrightconfig.json` automatically based on my selection.
  </p>

  <h2>Getting Functions That Write <code>pyrightconfig.json</code></h2>
  <p>
    <b>Edit 2022-11-20:</b> Thanks to Mickey Petersen
    of <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/">mastering emacs</a> for
    pointing out that <code>
      json-encode
    </code> exists.  I originally had my own
    function <code>pyrightconfig--json-contents</code> here, but I've modified
    the function below to use this built-in version instead.
  </p>

  <p>
    We really just need to do three things:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Prompt for a directory that houses a Python virtual environment</li>
    <li>
      Break the result into an absolute parent path + base name, cleaning any
      Tramp prefix in the process
    </li>
    <li>
      Write the contents of =pyrightconfig--json-contents= using the previous
      result to a file in the version control root.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    It's worth mentioning that we /must/ put this file in the VC root, otherwise
    <code>eglot</code> just won't pick it up.  For my purposes, the VC system
    will always be git, so I'm going to make an assumption here and use
    =vc-git-root= instead of something more generic.
  </p>

  <pre>
(defun pyrightconfig-write (virtualenv)
  (interactive "DEnv: ")

  (let* (;; file-truename and tramp-file-local-name ensure that neither `~' nor
         ;; the Tramp prefix (e.g. "/ssh:my-host:") wind up in the final
         ;; absolute directory path.
         (venv-dir (tramp-file-local-name (file-truename virtualenv)))

         ;; Given something like /path/to/.venv/, this strips off the trailing `/'.
         (venv-file-name (directory-file-name venv-dir))

         ;; Naming convention for venvPath matches the field for
         ;; pyrightconfig.json.  `file-name-directory' gets us the parent path
         ;; (one above .venv).
         (venvPath (file-name-directory venv-file-name))

         ;; Grabs just the `.venv' off the end of the venv-file-name.
         (venv (file-name-base venv-file-name))

         ;; Eglot demands that `pyrightconfig.json' is in the project root
         ;; folder.
         (base-dir (vc-git-root default-directory))
         (out-file (expand-file-name "pyrightconfig.json" base-dir))

         ;; Finally, get a string with the JSON payload.
         (out-contents (json-encode (list :venvPath venvPath :venv venv))))

    ;; Emacs uses buffers for everything.  This creates a temp buffer, inserts
    ;; the JSON payload, then flushes that content to final `pyrightconfig.json'
    ;; location
    (with-temp-file out-file (insert out-contents))))
  </pre>

  <p>
    Here's a quick demo where I interactively choose a virtual environment
    directory, write the ~pyrightconfig.json~, launch ~eglot~, and use =M-.= to
    leverage the LSP's jump-to-definition of a library, then show that the
    library we jumped to is indeed inside the virtual environment.
